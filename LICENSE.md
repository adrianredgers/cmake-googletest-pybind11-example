I, Adrian Redgers, created this project,
cmake-googletest-pybind11-example, in April 2018.

I am publishing it for my own amusement, kudos, and 
to add to the sum of knowledge.

I want anyone to be allowed to copy, edit and use it for
free in their projects, private or commercial.
I don't want anyone to blame me for any problems that
occur as a result of anyone using it.

I think the Creative commons licence Attribution CC By 4.0 licence
covers this:
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

And that is what I want, except where it covers "attribution",
which is something I do not care about.

I want anyone who uses this project to agree to these terms.

Also, I want this licence only to be a defence against any
other legal action in relation to this project - I do not
want to bring any legal action of my own first.
