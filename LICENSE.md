I, Adrian Redgers, created this project in April 2018.

I am publishing it for my own amusement, kudos, and 
to add to the sum of knowledge.

My intention is that anyone should be allowed to copy it, edit it 
and use it for free in their projects private or commercial.
And no-one should blame me for any problems that occur as a
result of anyone using it.

The Creative commons licence Attribution CC By 4.0 licence
covers this:
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

And that is what I intend, except it also covers "attribution",
which I do not care about.

My intention is that anyone who uses this project agrees to
those terms.

Also, I intend this licence only to be a defence against any
other legal action in relation to this project - I do not
intend to bring any legal action of my own first.
